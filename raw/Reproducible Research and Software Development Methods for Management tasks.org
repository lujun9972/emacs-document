The amount of administrative tasks in today's workplace is steadily
growing, whether you are a manager or just driven by requirements from
management for more and more reports. The introduction of IT into these
processes held the big potential of easing some of the tedious tasks
through automatization and integration, but it seems that we are still a
long way away from that goal. Segregated toolchains, lack of compatibility
of interfaces and different work cultures combined with the increased
amount of communication have resulted in an increase of
stress and drudgery. Dealing with the fallout often requires substantial manual
effort, frequently in a form which is not reusable and sustainable.

What can we as scientists and software engineers do to improve our
situation? I am asking this in the most pragmatic sense and I will
describe what I found over the last years to work for me. So, this is
not about demanding that the world suddenly becomes perfect and
reasonable by magically establishing compatible standards and adopt
harmonized best practices agreed on by everyone - this will not
happen. I just want to demonstrate that we can just use our knowledge
from science and engineering and combine them smartly with existing
frameworks. My own background is in physical chemistry with long years
working in scientific computing, so management is for me another
acquired skill which I had to grow into (and sometimes I still feel
baffled by some of the concepts...).

So let's see what we can do based on the toolchains that we learn in
data science and software engineering. I will use [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/][GNU Emacs]] to present
my current workflow, but the ideas are generic and you may find other solutions.

If you are just interested into the Emacs workflow using my new package [[https://github.com/dfeich/org-listcruncher][org-listcruncher]]
you can just scroll down to [[#org6196d0c][the example section]].

** 1 The problem

The sad reality is that a lot of management document methodology
comes in the form of Excel and Powerpoint documents. While I think that Excel
is a good piece of software for enabling people to obtain results fast and
in a nicely interactive way, it's work model for complex or
long-lived documents is definitely sub-optimal.

Reasons

- *changes to the document are difficult to track* in a transparent and comprehensible way.
  Compare this to the established way we track software changes in revision control
  systems like git. There we not only track each change, but also the motivations for it.
- as the Excel documents gets bigger, it tends to contain many sheets with lots of references.
  Errors easily creep in and are difficult to spot (e.g. numbers outside of formula cell ranges
  which are silently ignored). Compare this to *unit tests and integration tests* that we use
  continually in software development and scientific programming.
- there is a lot of copy & paste going on, from the Excel sheet into
  a word document used as a report, to a Powerpoint to do a
  presentation. In data science we also take care to *track the
  changes to data (data provenance)* and to make sure that a document
  references a dataset in a clearly identifyable way.

** 2 What we want

Let's take as an example the planning of a complex budget over several years.

- We would like to have way to put down our budget entries in a form which
  *allows adding comments and other meta data* to explain the entry.
- When we get improved forecast information, we would like to be able and override
  previous information without deleting it, so that an *audit trail* is conserved.
- The format in which we write down all of this information should lend itself to
  *automatically generate a data set* that can be manipulated with state of the art
  tools.
- The *code producing the budget forecasts and plots should be a part of the document*,
  so that we can hand it to somebody else, and she can easily understand how we came
  to the numbers.
- The format should be easily *manageable by standard revision control systems*, so that
  we can nicely document the changes over time.
- *Produce beautiful and readable documents* in a mostly automatic way for optimal
  readability.
- Since our management very often desires Excel or other formats, we
  would also like to *be able and export to these other formats as
  well*... but all from the same source.

** 3 Three Musketeers to the Rescue

*** 3.1 Reproducible Research

*Reproducible research* is an important topic in today's IT
research and it also has a big significance for our society and the
ethics of conducting research. It is important to keep the
underlying data, algorithms, and argumentation, so that others can
follow the analysis of the data and understand the
conclusions. Today's interest in SW containers like Docker is apart
from being a great deployment mechanism also powered by this desire
to allow the conservation of computational environments in an
easily sharable form.

The concept of /Reproducible research/ is closely related to the
idea of *literate programing* that Donald Knuth launched with [[http://www.literateprogramming.com/knuthweb.pdf][his
seminal article]] in 1984. Literate programming environments allow
the free mixing of code parts with extensive documentation
parts. The source of a literate programming document contains all
necessary data as well as the code for manipulating the data to
produce results and plots. It also contains all the text and
argumentation. Out of this source document one then can generate a
nice publication, but also other derived information (e.g. a
standalone software program and a data set, or an excel sheet to
give to management).

[[https://orgmode.org/][Org mode for Emacs]] is one such environment, but there are also
others (e.g. look at [[https://reproducibleresearch.net/links/][this list of links]] maintained by
reproducibleresearch.net). Another open source environment in rapid
development is given by [[http://jupyter.org/][Jupyter notebooks]]. They are very popular
among scientists. These frameworks are not only great for
publishing research in a reproducible manner, but also are becoming
one of the best teaching aids, since students can easily experiment
with self-contained documents.

*** 3.2 Software Best Practices

Changes of source code should be tracked by *revision control
systems* (RCS) like [[https://git-scm.com/][git]]. An optimal tracking is possible, if the
differences from one version of a document to the next can be
easily visualized. This usually requires that the document format
is in a text based format and not some closed binary format.
The RCS help us to track changes through time, and we also can
add metadata in the form of comments to explain the motivations for the
changes.

*Humans will make errors*, and each time one does something non-trivial, especially
when it is of a repetitive nature, errors easily creep in. Also, doing changes
in one part of a complex thing may cause other parts of our wonderful ivory tower
computation to collapse. So, in SW engineering the ideas of *unit and intergration tests*
has become an accepted paradigm.

*Versioning.* Documents should be versioned in a clearly defined way similar as
to what we do with widely accepted standards like [[https://semver.org/][semantic versioning]].

*Templating and Repetition* Repetitive parts in a document, e.g. if
for a budget of many services a certain basic text/table/graphics
structure needs to be repeated multiple times, we would like to
generate it by a single code block that we call with different
arguments - and not by copy/paste and manual editing. Senseless
repetition or copy/paste is useless human toil and leads to
errors. later changes to the basic structure should not involve us
in making changes in a hundered places.

*** 3.3 Data Analysis Tools

There exists a plethora of programming languages and libraries to
deal with data in all of its forms. In particular, *Python* is a
language which has found increasing adoption by the scientific
community over the last decade. It is expressive and provides a
wealth of libraries and also frameworks for interactive data
analysis. Naturally there are other solutions as well, e.g. [[https://www.r-project.org/][the R
project]].

Since I am a Python person, I will recommend the following libraries for tackling
the kind of management related problems we are talking about

- [[https://pandas.pydata.org/][Pandas]]: easy-to-use data structures and data analysis tools
- [[http://www.numpy.org/][numpy]]: fundamental package for scientific computing. Used by Pandas
- [[https://matplotlib.org/][matplotlib]] and [[https://seaborn.pydata.org/][seaborn]] for visualization

** 4 An example workflow using Emacs Org mode and python

In the following I will demonstrate my own planning workflow that I
built up over the last years using Emacs and its fabulous
Org-Mode.

Emacs is a fantastic environment for programmers, since the whole
editor is an extensible lisp environment with a vibrant community producing
new packages.

*** 4.1 Plan using an outliner

Outliners are ideal for jotting down thoughts and ideas. Some
people may prefer mind-maps, but in the end the underlying data
structures are mostly identical. The outliner lists are certainly
more efficient for a proficient typist and are easily mixed with
other parts of a text.

I have used outlines for years for the initial planning of most tasks.
Actually the approach is now so engrained with me that I use lists as
the starting point for almost all documents I write. Their inherent
simple structure allows to express the main ideas as top level items, and then
use Sub-items to further refine them or add newer information in a way that
is transparent.

I also have used this approach for drawing up project and service
budgets for our scientific computing section over the last years,
But only now I implemented a better way to automatically derive a
useful data structure from such a list in a new Emacs package
[[https://github.com/dfeich/org-listcruncher][org-listcruncher]] (you can get the [[https://melpa.org/#/org-listcruncher][package from MELPA]]).

Here is an example of a planning list for a budget of two (non-IT) services.

[[/www/assets/images/org-listcruncher-list1.png]]

My rules for writing such a planning list are

1. Each line contains a tag defining wheter the line will become a table row. For this
   example I defined this as the string "item:". Rows without such a tag just serve as
   metadata.
2. A string following the output tag "item:" is taken as the description of the table row.
3. Each line can contain any number of key/value pairs in parentheses in the form
   =(key1: val1, key2: val2, ...)=
4. Lines of lower hierarchical order in the list inherit their default settings for key/values
   from the upper items.
5. The key value of a higher order item can be overwritten by a new new value for the same key
   in a lower order line.

Note that [[https://github.com/dfeich/org-listcruncher][org-listcruncher]] allows the user to supply an own parsing function, so the
rules for how the key/values, the description, and the tagging for a row can get
arbitrarily defined by the end user. The present default function is just an easy example.

One can easily imagine using the same kind of approach to derive a table of ingredients and their amounts
from the instructions of a cooking recipe that is given as a sequential list of steps. Just needs a bit
a smarter parsing function.

*** 4.2 Generate a table from the outline

We now would like to derive from the planning list a more suitable
data format for doing computations. A table is an optimal
format. The main function of [[https://github.com/dfeich/org-listcruncher][org-listcruncher]] provides just this
conversion. Based on the semantics defined in the previous section.

The following Org mode code block contains a single line of Emacs
lisp for calling org-listcruncher's main function and uses the
above list (which I named =lstShipGalante=) to create a table based
on an "outer join" of all the keys found with the respective values
arranged in columns.

[[/www/assets/images/org-listcruncher-table1.png]]

The list from which we generate the table can later be further
edited, and all derived results will change accordingly when
recalculating the whole document. The audit trail is conserved in
the list itself through the comments, and naturally it will also be
conserved in the commits into the revision control system.

*** 4.3 Data analysis and visualization

Now, as the data is in an easily accessible form, we can use Org mode's Babel feature to
read in the table into a python code block and perform some Pandas data
manipulation magic on it.

[[/www/assets/images/org-listcruncher-tablegrouped1.png]]

And another little code block lets us visualize cuts of the data with matplotlib and seaborn.

[[/www/assets/images/org-listcruncher-src-for-plot1.png]]

And we can generate the plots for our report.

*** 4.4 Versioning, templates, testing

I will only refer cursorily how to address the other points

- Org mode is part of Emacs which offers a number of powerful templating systems. Org itself supports
  Macros which can generate text parts.
- Versioning can easily be combined with org mode documents and integrated in the common ways with
  revision control systems like git (e.g. via tags)
- testing: Since org offers native inclusion of code snippets in different programming languages, tests
  can easily be formulated in the avaible test frameworks of these languages. One can also
  define simple tests in form of document code blocks putting out warnings into the document.
