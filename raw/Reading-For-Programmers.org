内容提要: 使用三步阅读法(verify(查证)-grasp(领会)-analyse(分解))轻松阅读 [[https://twitter.com/peel/status/840604048629874688][数百篇论文]]. 使用 org-mode (w/ helm-bibtex, org-ref and interleave) 来记笔记.

* Introduction

随着计算资源迅速变得廉价以及分布式编程的兴起,软件商务与学术贴合的越来越紧密.
现在软件得以,而且确实严重依赖于学术的进步. 
前沿研究应用于日常代码也开始变得很常见. 我们当然可以忽略代码背后的那些概念,但是也可以拥抱变化,努力适应这一变化. 
你可以使用现成的库和开源方案并忽略其内部原理,也可以尝试去理解这些方案的理念,查看其内部实现.
要跟上科学进步的步伐需要有强大的意志力,甚至有时为了阅读一片科技论文需要进行10个阅读步骤.
(Following the scientific advancements requires a significant willpower and either way it merely leads toward 10 Stages of Reading a Scientific Paper[[https://codearsonist.com/reading-for-programmers#fn.1][1]].)
不过你大可不必如此,只需要使用某个方法就可以跳过那些令人痛苦的步骤...

* Three-pass reading

不止一次地,有人提出[[https://codearsonist.com/reading-for-programmers#fn.2][2]], [[https://codearsonist.com/reading-for-programmers#fn.3][3]] 阅读论文 (事实上是阅读任何需要充分理解高级概念的东西) 需要分多步来进行. 
其主要思想是,在每次阅读论文时,你的头脑中都需要有一个明确的目标.
第一步,你需要查证这篇文章及其内容; 第二步,你需要领会文章的大意; 第三步,你完全理解这些概念 and get your notes flowing. 

** First pass - Verify

The first pass provides you with a high-level view of the contents. Helps you avoid getting
stuck in a badly written, uninteresting, wrong or simply beyond your current knowledge
text. To get the most from the first pass I usually start with references. And although
statistically 80% of the authors never read the cited texts in full [[https://codearsonist.com/reading-for-programmers#fn.4][4]], they provide a great
overview of what to expect. Whenever approaching a complex, long paper I tend to mark the
cited papers I've read. So I can get back to my infamous notes) or verify the background.
Reading the papers starts with the title, abstract and introduction which I read carefully the
first time I approach a paper. They are the first sign of whether the article is the one to go
with. After that I scan through the article focusing on section headings, graphical elements
and math formulas. I also read the results and discussion section to have an overview of
where I will be lead with the article. The author of "How to read papers"[[https://codearsonist.com/reading-for-programmers#fn.2][2]] paper, that was
recently trending over at HackerNews suggests that the first pass shall give you an answer
to 5Cs: 

+ Category - what type of paper is this? 
+ Context - which other papers it is related to? which theoretical bases were used to analyze the problem? 
+ Correctness - do the assumptions appear to be valid? 
+ Contributions - what are the paper's main contributions? 
+ Clarity - is it well written? 

For me after the first reading, aside from the bird's eye view of the paper, allows to decide
whether I should give it a second pass. Personally I ask myself: 

+ What's in it for me? 
+ Do I have enough background? 

Reading papers can greatly improve your knowledge, provide you with practical solutions,
methodologies of doing things or even experimental design concepts. Yet papers do require
prior knowledge - a background. Whenever after the first pass I see a gaping hole of missing
background I mark article as TODO, tag with :advanced: and leave it until I am able to read
it or go through references and the Internet and build up the background. 

** Second pass - Grasp concepts

I start the second pass with the goal of grasping the concepts and supporting evidence so I
can describe it to a fellow programmer over a beer. I usually sync it to my Onyx Boox large
screen epaper reader to avoid printing. This allows me to conveniently follow thought
process, paying attention to concepts without going deep into its execution. While reading I
mark, highlight or scribble notes on the side of the paper. A quick rescan will later show me
the paper's major points. I try to work my way through diagrams and graphical
representations. Whenever hitting stuff I do not comprehend, it's usually pretty easy to see
whether it will prevent me from following the concepts this rendering further reading useless
or it's a thing I can jot down and learn later on. The blockers have to be handled immedietely
before going any further. So… google that, search my notes, learn. Next thing I also focus on
on the second pass is inline references. Some of the references are instant hook, so I add
them to TODO papers list. With the second pass I have a scribbled, marked and highlighted
article, understand the concepts and can share the idea. The thing is however that for the
essential concepts it's still not enough. Thus the third pass. 

** Third pass - Critique

The third pass is obviously for the highly interesting papers I need to comprehend. I work my
way through the parts I missed previously and try to see the results/discussion in a larger
spectrum. Ie. How does profunctor optics relate to extensive domains we've built? The third
pass is also where I tend to differ from some of the academics. It is said, that in order to
review a paper you need to recreate it without copying. I usually do that only with the
papers that are vital to my work. I pick the tools I use and try to rebuild that. Indeed it can
make one angry. It will get on your nerves and you will hate the ideas. But in the end the
grand idea is usually worth it. The third pass usually ends up with a bit of code and notes.
Or just the notes. But the notes are where it all belongs. Third pass is for the active reader.
Even if the article is not core to the things I do and I decide not to fiddle around in REPL I am
an active reader. I mark even more things, note stuff (that usually won't fit in margins) on
the side. I don't copy stuff. Use my own words so I process it. I use structured notes -
outline. I critically look for inconsistencies. Is the reasoning right? Is the samples number
sufficient? 

* The Notes

I have been tinkering with the notes workflow for a couple of years. With lots of notes and
papers read it gets tedious to grep files for related notes. And it is somewhere on the verge
of madness to have it all stored in a paper notebook. As an avid Emacs uses I have been
taking notes with the almighty [[http://orgmode.org][org-mode]]. An extensible Emacs major mode for all things
text/data related. With org-mode's minimal syntax and tree layout it is incredibly easy to
structure and extend the simple, single-file knowledge base. 

** The workflow

I have been keeping a huge notes papers.org and a references papers.bib files for a couple
of years now. The files contain an abysmal list of books, papers and articles I've been tagging
as TODO. Usually to avoid fiddling around I just add a quick TODO of a document with an
org-capture[[https://codearsonist.com/reading-for-programmers#fn.5][5]] template (be it paper, article, link, whatever). Every now and then (usually
whenever picking the next paper to read) I go through the file and turn the captures into
proper Bibtex references.

Figure 2: Bibtex has been a de-facto standard reference management system for years now

Bibtex has been a de-facto standard reference management system for years now. Hence it
is perfectly possible to grab all the necessary document details from the Internet. Either by
searching by name, title, tag or… a pdf file. I usually either drag and drop a downloaded pdf
onto Emacs window with references files so it fetches the data on it's own. Or… just use the
beautiful [[https://github.com/tmalsburg/helm-bibtex][helm-bibtex]] which allows me to quickly access all the major scientific search
engines from arxiv to google scholar.

Figure 3: helm-bibtex allows quick access to references

I also turn the capture TODO into a document TODO task in the papers.org itself. However to
keep thing optimised, it gets done using the reference - enter [[https://github.com/jkitchin/org-ref][org-ref]]. A quick shortcut and
the reference and TODO are now linked. My usual workflow for taking notes starts with the
third pass which I usually do in Emacs' [[https://github.com/politza/pdf-tools][pdf-tools]] anyway. Running a REPL or a worksheet
side-by-side with a paper is invaluable. Same goes for taking notes. And guess what,
everything I have done so far enables me to use a single command to link notes to specific
places in a pdf. Enabling interleave mode (M-x interleave, duh) on given subtree (with
:INTERLEAVE_PDF: property set) allows that by simply attaching pdf location. And voila: 

[[https://codearsonist.com/img/rfp-interleave.png]]

Figure 4: iterleave allows linking notes to pdf parts

With that at hand I'm able to effectively keep the notes neatly connected to source material.
And between each other using org-mode subtree search and tags. 

** The setup

The setup is indeed prety straight-forward to achieve. A couple of packages and a minimal
configuration options. I store my dotfiles in a github repository. My (now migrated from plain
ol' init.el) spacemacs config's there as well. Feel free to [[https://dotfiles.codearsonist.com][roam around and steal stuff -]]
[[https://dotfiles.codearsonist.com][dotfiles.codearsonist.com]]. 

*** pdf-tools

A prereq for Emacs to be able to display pdfs properly. I'm using stock configuration without
extra options. 

*** org-ref

org-ref also requires just a minimal setup to get the wheels turning and the configuration
corresponds the helm-bibtex one: 

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq org-ref-notes-directory "$SOME"
        org-ref-bibliography-notes "$SOME/index.org"
        org-ref-default-bibliography '("$SOME/index.bib")
        org-ref-pdf-directory "$SOME/lib/")
#+END_SRC

*** helm-bibtex

I guess org-ref config should be propagated down to the helm-bibtex one. But here's how
you'd configure helm-bibtex directly: 

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq helm-bibtex-bibliography "$SOME/index.bib" ;; where your references are stored
        helm-bibtex-library-path "$SOME/lib/" ;; where your pdfs etc are stored
        helm-bibtex-notes-path "$SOME/index.org" ;; where your notes are stored
        bibtex-completion-bibliography "$SOME/index.bib" ;; writing completion
        bibtex-completion-notes-path "$SOME/index.org"
        )
#+END_SRC

*** interleave

None. Set the :INTERLEAVE_PDF: property on subtree in papers.org and you're done 🎉️ 

* Picking the next paper

As a side note. The Internet is full of papers. Hackernews, Twitter stream, Reddit produce
must read items quicker than we will ever be able to follow. From my personal experience
though the best source of papers are simply references from other papers. Each specialty
has its own paper 'canon'. Start with them and gradually work your way towards others
either by following citations (CiteSeer, Google Scholar) or references directly. Keep in mind
that citations number is a pretty good sanity check whenever a paper is getting
recommended. 

* Summary

Armed with a method of reading scientific material I have read numerous deeply technical
papers. Often beyond my usual knowledge level. The approach allows me for improving my
reading skills (also see: [[https://codearsonist.com/reading-for-programmers#fn.6][6]]) with each paper I read. The more I read the better my
understanding is. I am able to share the knowledge by discussing it with other people. All
the above is the basic workflow idea I have been working with and find it perfect for my
needs. There is more to it including automated tag dependency graphing I have
implemented. But that is a separate (long) story…
