Org-mode Workflow Part 4: Automatic Web Publishing

Some were curious about how I was automatically publishing my
Org files, so I thought I'd try to give some insight into the process.
You can find the Github repo [[https://github.com/jethrokuan/braindump/][here]].

I prefer my tools to be as simple as possible, but I'm also somewhat
lazy, so I tend to use whatever was easiest. Previously, I'd be using
Org's in-built HTML export, but it was missing a bunch of niceties
that weren't that trivial to implement, like RSS and sitemaps. This
was also [[https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/6qahdz/what%5Fare%5Fyou%5Fcurrently%5Fdeveloping%5Fin%5Femacs%5Flisp/dkvxgvs?utm%5Fsource=share&utm%5Fmedium=web2x][around the time when Kaushal Modi's ox-hugo package was
starting to take shape]] (See a pattern here? Lot's of the things I use
is just a matter of timing), so I went with =ox-hugo=.

** Using Ox-hugo
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: using-ox-hugo
   :END:

=ox-hugo= exports your Org files into Markdown files, depending on how
you configure it. I use the one-post-per-file configuration, so every
Org file within my folder gets exported to a separate Markdown file,
and will have its own webpage. For example, [[https://github.com/jethrokuan/braindump/blob/master/org/actor%5Fcritic.org][org/actor_critic.org]]
generates [[https://github.com/jethrokuan/braindump/blob/master/content/posts/actor%5Fcritic.md][contents/posts/actor_critic.md]]. [[https://gohugo.io/][Hugo]] will then take these
Markdown files and generate the appropriate HTML, just like any other
Hugo site.

The one-post-per-file configuration works great with the Zettelkasten
method, where notes are meant to be short. It's also the configuration
where linking between files actually works (it generates relative web
links).

** Org-ref
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: org-ref
   :END:

[[https://github.com/jkitchin/org-ref][Org-ref]] is a package that helps with bibliography management. I'd
noticed that =org-ref= citations were being exported in a curious
format that didn't look nice in Hugo, and had found that this was the
default markdown export style from =org-ref=. There wasn't an easy way
to change this style either, so I overrode all the related functions
and packaged those into [[https://github.com/jethrokuan/org-ref-ox-hugo/][jethrokuan/org-ref-ox-hugo]]. Here's my
configuration for that.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
  (use-package org-ref-ox-hugo
   :straight (:host github :repo "jethrokuan/org-ref-ox-hugo" :branch "custom/overrides")
   :after org org-ref ox-hugo
   :config
   (add-to-list 'org-ref-formatted-citation-formats
   '("md"
   ("article" . "${author}, *${title}*, ${journal}, *${volume}(${number})*, ${pages} (${year}). ${doi}")
   ("inproceedings" . "${author}, *${title}*, In ${editor}, ${booktitle} (pp. ${pages}) (${year}). ${address}: ${publisher}.")
   ("book" . "${author}, *${title}* (${year}), ${address}: ${publisher}.")
   ("phdthesis" . "${author}, *${title}* (Doctoral dissertation) (${year}). ${school}, ${address}.")
   ("inbook" . "${author}, *${title}*, In ${editor} (Eds.), ${booktitle} (pp. ${pages}) (${year}). ${address}: ${publisher}.")
   ("incollection" . "${author}, *${title}*, In ${editor} (Eds.), ${booktitle} (pp. ${pages}) (${year}). ${address}: ${publisher}.")
   ("proceedings" . "${editor} (Eds.), _${booktitle}_ (${year}). ${address}: ${publisher}.")
   ("unpublished" . "${author}, *${title}* (${year}). Unpublished manuscript.")
   ("misc" . "${author} (${year}). *${title}*. Retrieved from [${howpublished}](${howpublished}). ${note}.")
   (nil . "${author}, *${title}* (${year})."))))
#+END_EXAMPLE

** Netlify
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: netlify
   :END:

Setting up automatic publishing is trivial with [[https://www.netlify.com/][Netlify]], which has
first-class support for Hugo websites. Just create an account, and use
the default Hugo build settings, which looks something like this:

[[https://d33wubrfki0l68.cloudfront.net/200eac90c91bf0d9fdaf88ef1d26a62efaed9159/b430f/ox-hugo/screenshot2019-12-20_17-37-17_.png]]

Figure 1: Netlify Build settings

Now each push to =master= branch will trigger a build and publish in
Netlify.

** Summary
   :PROPERTIES:
   :CUSTOM_ID: summary
   :END:

In sum, I used =ox-hugo= for making Hugo more Org-compatible,
=org-ref= and some hacks (=org-ref-ox-hugo=) to make citations look
nice, and Netlify to publish the website. This blog is also similarly
powered by Netlify.

Hope that helps!
