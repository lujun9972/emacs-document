If you’re a frequent reader, no doubt you noticed an embedded Youtube video on
a post [[http://endlessparentheses.com/debugger-improvements-in-cider-0-10-0.html][a couple of weeks ago]]. Youtube makes it pretty simple to embed videos,
they give you the entire iframe HTML code to use, but this wouldn’t really be
Emacs if we couldn’t make things just a little bit easier. Just add the
snippet below to your init file, and you’re good to go.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defvar yt-iframe-format
    ;; You may want to change your width and height.
    (concat "<iframe width=\"440\""
            " height=\"335\""
            " src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/%s\""
            " frameborder=\"0\""
            " allowfullscreen>%s</iframe>"))

  (org-add-link-type
   "yt"
   (lambda (handle)
     (browse-url
      (concat "https://www.youtube.com/embed/"
              handle)))
   (lambda (path desc backend)
     (cl-case backend
       (html (format yt-iframe-format
                     path (or desc "")))
       (latex (format "\href{%s}{%s}"
                      path (or desc "video"))))))
#+END_SRC

To use this, just write your org links in the following way (optionally adding
a description).

#+BEGIN_SRC org
  [[yt:A3JAlWM8qRM]]
#+END_SRC

When you export to HTML, this will produce that same inlined snippet that
Youtube specifies. The advantage (over simply writing out the iframe) is that
this link can be clicked in org-mode, and can be exported to other formats as
well.
