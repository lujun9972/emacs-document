Spacemacs is the first Emacs version I used, so I'm kind of attached to the =evil-mode= and =SPC= mnemonic key binding.

But I always have a feeling that something is not right, Spacemacs hides a lot of things under the hood, and it loads a lot of stuff that I do not need during the startup. This would be a huge waste, and I need to have a fresh setup that I can control every single thing in my editor.

So I created my own Emacs configuration, it's surprisingly easier than as I thought.

[[https://huytd.github.io/img/custom-emacs.png]]

In this post, I'll go through the steps I built a minimal Spacemacs-like version, with some basic key binding:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    General:
     SPC / : ripgrep
     SPC TAB : previous buffer
     SPC SPC : Open M-x

    Files:
     SPC p f : find files

    Buffers:
     SPC b b : buffers list

    Window:
     SPC w l : move right
     SPC w h : move left 
     SPC w j : move down
     SPC w k : move up
     SPC w / : split right
     SPC w - : split bottom
     SPC w x : close window

    Other:
     SPC a t : open terminal in current buffer
#+END_SRC

* 1 Configuration file

First, we need to create a =init.el= file:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    $ mkdir -p ~/.emacs.d
    $ touch ~/.emacs.d/init.el
#+END_SRC

Now, Emacs will start with the ugly tools bar and status bar, just like any editor that I would uninstall right away. Let's change this.

* 2 Minimal UI

Now, we need to disable all the ugly stuff and make Emacs just as clean and clear as Vim or Sublime, Atom,... or whatever modern editor today has.

Put these to the beginning of your =init.el=:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    ;; Minimal UI
    (scroll-bar-mode -1)
    (tool-bar-mode -1)
    (tooltip-mode -1)
    (menu-bar-mode -1)
#+END_SRC

* 3 Font and Frame Size

By default, Emacs will starts with a default monospace font and squared size window. We can change this by adding these settings:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(font . "mononoki-12"))
    (add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(height . 24))
    (add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(width . 80))
#+END_SRC

In the above config, we set the default font face to =mononoki= and font size is =12=. We also set the frame dimension into =80x24=, just like any default terminal emulator size.

Next, we'll add a package manager to start installing themes/packages.

* 4 Package Manager

By default, Emacs is configured to use =ELPA= package archive, we'll need to add more repository such as =GNU ELPA=, =MELPA=,...

Put this to the beginning of your =init.el=:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    ;; Package configs
    (require 'package)
    (setq package-enable-at-startup nil)
    (setq package-archives '(("org" . "http://orgmode.org/elpa/")
     ("gnu" . "http://elpa.gnu.org/packages/")
     ("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/")))
    (package-initialize)
#+END_SRC

Next, we'll use [[https://github.com/jwiegley/use-package][use-package]] to configure our packages better, in case you don't know, this package provides a macro to allow you to easily install packages and isolate package configuration in a way that is both performance-oriented and tidy.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    ;; Bootstrap `use-package`
    (unless (package-installed-p 'use-package)
     (package-refresh-contents)
     (package-install 'use-package))
    (require 'use-package)
#+END_SRC

* 5 Vim key binding with Evil Mode

Now that you have package manager setted up, let's install our first package: =evil-mode=, this package allows you to use Vim-like key binding in Emacs.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    ;; Vim mode
    (use-package evil
     :ensure t
     :config
     (evil-mode 1))
#+END_SRC

I personally prefer using =jk= for escape key, so I'll install =evil-escape= and have this setting:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (use-package evil-escape
     :ensure t
     :init
     (setq-default evil-escape-key-sequence "jk")
     :config
     (evil-escape-mode 1))
#+END_SRC

That's it! Now restart your Emacs, you'll see the mode line displaying the current Vim mode, and you'll be able to navigate with =hjkl=.

* 6 Installing Theme

One of the best theme for Emacs I could found is =doom-themes= package, that has a lot of cool themes. The following code will install this package and load its flagship theme =doom-one=:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    ;; Theme
    (use-package doom-themes
     :ensure t
     :config
     (load-theme 'doom-one t))
#+END_SRC

* 7 Installing Helm

[[https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm][Helm]] is a framework for incremental completions and narrowing selections in Emacs. Many people prefer =ivy= because it's much lighter, for me, it's doesn't matter. I find =helm= is easier to use and config.

The following snippet will install =helm= and configure /fuzzy matching/:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    ;; Helm
    (use-package helm
     :ensure t
     :init
     (setq helm-M-x-fuzzy-match t
     helm-mode-fuzzy-match t
     helm-buffers-fuzzy-matching t
     helm-recentf-fuzzy-match t
     helm-locate-fuzzy-match t
     helm-semantic-fuzzy-match t
     helm-imenu-fuzzy-match t
     helm-completion-in-region-fuzzy-match t
     helm-candidate-number-list 150
     helm-split-window-in-side-p t
     helm-move-to-line-cycle-in-source t
     helm-echo-input-in-header-line t
     helm-autoresize-max-height 0
     helm-autoresize-min-height 20)
     :config
     (helm-mode 1))
#+END_SRC

* 8 Installing Which Key

In Spacemacs, when you press =SPC= or any other key sequence, a small buffer will be popped up to show the list of features you can do next, installing =which-key= will give you this.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    ;; Which Key
    (use-package which-key
     :ensure t
     :init
     (setq which-key-separator " ")
     (setq which-key-prefix-prefix "+")
     :config
     (which-key-mode 1))
#+END_SRC

* 9 Custom Key Binding

Finally, you can start config your custom key binding with =general= package, this is my config, the prefix is =SPC= just like in Spacemacs:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    ;; Custom keybinding
    (use-package general
     :ensure t
     :config (general-define-key
     :states '(normal visual insert emacs)
     :prefix "SPC"
     :non-normal-prefix "M-SPC"
     ;; "/" '(counsel-rg :which-key "ripgrep") ; You'll need counsel package for this
     "TAB" '(switch-to-prev-buffer :which-key "previous buffer")
     "SPC" '(helm-M-x :which-key "M-x")
     "pf" '(helm-find-files :which-key "find files")
     ;; Buffers
     "bb" '(helm-buffers-list :which-key "buffers list")
     ;; Window
     "wl" '(windmove-right :which-key "move right")
     "wh" '(windmove-left :which-key "move left")
     "wk" '(windmove-up :which-key "move up")
     "wj" '(windmove-down :which-key "move bottom")
     "w/" '(split-window-right :which-key "split right")
     "w-" '(split-window-below :which-key "split bottom")
     "wx" '(delete-window :which-key "delete window")
     ;; Others
     "at" '(ansi-term :which-key "open terminal")
    ))
#+END_SRC

* 10 Matching Titlebar color on MacOS

If you're using Emacs on macOS, you can add this to have your titlebar color changed and matching your color theme:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    ;; Fancy titlebar for MacOS
    (add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(ns-transparent-titlebar . t))
    (add-to-list 'default-frame-alist '(ns-appearance . dark))
    (setq ns-use-proxy-icon nil)
    (setq frame-title-format nil)
#+END_SRC

* 11 Project Management

One of the most important thing to install at first is =projectile=, for manage projects in Emacs. In my configuration, I also unset the =projectile-require-project-root= option to have =projectile= recognize any folder as a project, not just ones with project files.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    ;; Projectile
    (use-package projectile
     :ensure t
     :init
     (setq projectile-require-project-root nil)
     :config
     (projectile-mode 1))
#+END_SRC

* 12 Optional: NeoTree and Icons

One thing that nice to have is =neotree=, which will display the folder tree. In this configuration, I also installed =all-the-icons= so =neotree= can be displayed with some nice graphical icons:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    ;; All The Icons
    (use-package all-the-icons :ensure t)

    ;; NeoTree
    (use-package neotree
     :ensure t
     :init
     (setq neo-theme (if (display-graphic-p) 'icons 'arrow)))
#+END_SRC

Just don't forget to run =M-x all-the-icons-install-fonts= after start your Emacs for the first time.

* 13 Optional: Matching Parentheses

This is a very helpful built-in feature of Emacs, by enable this, it will highlight any matching parentheses that the cursor is on.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    ;; Show matching parens
    (setq show-paren-delay 0)
    (show-paren-mode 1)
#+END_SRC

* 14 Optional: Disable backup files

I find it really annoying when Emacs automatically create a backup file for every buffer you opened, so I [[http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/emacs_set_backup_into_a_directory.html][disabled it]], you might not want to do this:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    ;; Disable backup files
    (setq make-backup-files nil) ; stop creating backup~ files
    (setq auto-save-default nil) ; stop creating #autosave# files
#+END_SRC

* 15 Optional: Problem with environment variables

If you got problem with environment variables or commands, for example, Emacs could not recognize `brew` or something, you might need to load your =.bashrc= or =.bash_profile= manually:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (let ((path (shell-command-to-string ". ~/.bashrc; echo -n $PATH")))
     (setenv "PATH" path)
     (setq exec-path 
     (append
     (split-string-and-unquote path ":")
     exec-path)))
#+END_SRC

From here, you can continue customizing Emacs as you need, for example, add more language supports, customize your mode line,...

I hope you'll find this post helpful and will be able to build your own Emacs configuration. Also, you can check my [[https://gist.github.com/huytd/6b785bdaeb595401d69adc7797e5c22c][customized configuration here]].
