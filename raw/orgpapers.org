* Introduction

This guide introduces an open-source toolkit for writing research
papers and monographs. The main features of this toolkit centered
around Emacs and Org-mode are:
+ embedded R code in the document that allows for statistical results
  to be revised and reproduced,
+ bibliographic citations from a personal bibliographic database,
+ formatting using well defined styles with minimal markup,
+ support for production of final output as pdf, odt, docx, html and
  many other formats.
** Will this guide be useful for you?

This guide will be useful for you if you are writing a research paper,
a dissertation or an academic book. It would be useful if your writing
involves one or more of the following:
 + Citing existing literature in your area
 + Presenting results of statistical analyses (in tabular form and/or
   graphically)
 + Using mathematical equations

Following this guide would need some investment of time but benefits
far outweigh the investment you make.

** What is our goal?

What are the most interesting features of the writing platform that
you will set up using this guide?

+ With easy style specifications that you provide, the document will
  be almost-entirely automatically formatted by the software.
  - Complicated LaTeX-style markup is a pain and Openoffice/MS-Word
    documents require too much manual formatting. Basic Org-mode
    mark-up is extremely simple, and can be mastered in very little
    time.
  - Org-mode can produce well formatted output in LaTeX, pdf, odt,
    docx, html and many other formats.

+ Instead of including statistical results (tables, graphs, etc), we
  would embed appropriate R programs in the document, so that when the
  formatted output is produced, all programs are run to generate the
  results. Advantages of doing this are:
  - Any changes in the data being used can be accommodated just by
    publishing the document again.
  - Any modifications in statistical analysis are easily made by
    modifying the programs that are embedded in the file itself.
  - Anyone who has the org file, can reproduce your results. You can
    also extract all R programs from the org file and distribute those
    for reproduction of your results.

+ The document will be integrated with a citation manager, so that
  bibliographic information will be pulled automatically from a
  central database to create a fully formatted bibliography.
  - You will maintain a bibliographic database in BibTeX format, that
    you can build over time, adding bibliographic information for
    works that you cite.
  - Many websites (including Google Scholar) provide bibliographic
    information directly in BibTeX format, and we will have integrated
    tools that will allow us to pull this information directly into
    our local database.

** Acknowledgements
In my adaptation of Org, I have benefitted immensely from the great
community of Orgers. The [[http://orgmode.org/manual/][Org-mode manual]], [[http://orgmode.org/worg/][Worg]], and archives of the
[[http://orgmode.org/community.html][Org-mode mailing list]] have been the most important resources. In
addition, I have greatly benefited from solutions provided by various
people to my specific queries on the Org-mode mailing list. What I
present in this document is essentially a synthesis of solutions
provided by various people. The community has been extremely generous
in providing these.

I would particularly like to thank

+ Carsten Dominik, the author of Org-mode.
+ Bastien Guerry, who has been a great maintainer of Org-mode, after
  Carsten passed on the baton to him.
+ Nicolas Goaziou, who wrote the brilliant new exporter framework. The
  amount of code Nicolas has contributed to Org over the last two
  years or so is incredible. Nicolas very kindly responded to several
  of my queries.
+ Eric Schulte, the main author of Babel, which gave Org mode the
  ability to execute code. I used to use Org-mode as a task manager
  and for taking notes. I discovered org-babel in the summer of 2010,
  when I was doing fieldwork in villages in eastern India. This
  discovery completely changed my work flow, and Org-mode became
  central to all my academic work.
+ In addition to the above, Suvayu Ali, for responses to several of my
  queries on the mailing list.

* Installing necessary software
This set up will work with any operating system. I have tested it on
GNU/Linux and Mac OS-X, but it should work on Windows as well. For
this setup, you need to install Emacs (Version 24 along with a few
additional Emacs packages), Texlive, R (along with whatever
additional R packages you want to use) and Pandoc.

** Emacs

+ GNU/Linux

  Emacs can be installed using package managers of all GNU/Linux
  distributions. Latest versions of most common distributions provide
  version 24. I strongly recommend using the latest version of Emacs.

+ Mac OS-X

  The built-in Emacs on OS-X is an older version, and it would be a
  good idea to install the latest version instead.

  The best option is to install it via homebrew. I like the version
  available from railwaycat/emacsmacport tap
  (https://github.com/railwaycat/emacs-mac-port).

  After installing homebrew, or if you already have it installed, just
  do the following from the terminal

  ~$ brew tap railwaycat/emacsmacport~

  ~$ brew install emacs-mac~

+ Microsoft Windows

  Download the latest version of Emacs from
  http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/emacs/windows/, and install.

** Texlive

+ GNU/Linux

  Texlive can also be installed from package managers in most
  GNU/Linux distribution.

+ Mac OS-X

  For OS-X, install MacTeX from http://www.tug.org/mactex/

+ Microsoft Windows

  For Windows, download Texlive and follow instructions from
  https://www.tug.org/texlive/doc.html

** R

In this guide, I assume that you are familiar with R
(http://www.r-project.org). I will not cover R programming in this
guide.

For GNU/Linux, R can be installed from native package managers (look
for r-base in debian and debian-based distributions). For Mac OS-X and
Windows, download and see installation instructions at
http://www.r-project.org

** Pandoc

Pandoc (http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/) is an extremely powerful
converter, which can translate one markup into another. It supports
conversion between many file formats, and supports "syntax for
footnotes, tables, flexible ordered lists, definition lists, fenced
code blocks, superscript, subscript, strikeout, title blocks,
automatic tables of contents, embedded LaTeX math, citations, and
markdown inside HTML block elements." That is pretty much everything I
use.

We shall use pandoc to convert our file from LaTeX to odt/docx/html
formats.

* Emacs basics

GNU Emacs is an extensible platform. Although its primary function is
as an editor, it can be extended to do almost anything that you would
want your computer to do. Now, that really is not an overstatement. It
is a worthwhile aim to slowly shift an increasing number of tasks you
do on your computer to emacs-based solutions. For each major task you
do on your computer, ask if it can be done using emacs. For almost
everything, the answer is yes, and in most cases, emacs does it better
than other software you are used to. Many emacs users have learnt
emacs by shifting, one-by-one, all major tasks that they
do on the computer to emacs.

I am not going to give a detailed guide to use of emacs. A few tasks
for which I use Emacs include
 + File management (copying files, moving files, creating directories)
 + Reading and writing e-mails
 + Reading RSS feeds
 + Calender, scheduler, planner
 + Calculator
 + Statistical work (by hooking Emacs to R)
 + And, of course, as an editor (including for writing research papers)

In this guide, I will just provide a minimal set of basic commands in
emacs to get you started. This is a minimal but sufficient set to be
able to work. I expect that you would learn more commands as you start
using emacs.

** Notations

In emacs, a buffer is equivalent to a tab in a web browser. It is
normal to have several buffers open at the same time. Each file opens
in emacs as a buffer. Buffers could also have processes like R running
in them. Emacs displays any messages for you in a separate buffer.

Most commands in emacs are given using the Control (ctrl) or the Meta
(often mapped to alt) keys.[fn:3] Control key is usually referred to as ~C-~
and the Meta key as ~M-~. So a command ~C-c~ means pressing Control
and c together. Command ~M-x~ means pressing Meta and x
together. Everything is case-sensitive. So ~M-X~ would mean, pressing
Meta, Shift and x together. ~C-c M-x l~ would mean pressing C-c,
release, then M-x, release, and then l.

** Basic commands

Table [[essential-emacs-commands]] gives the commands that are the most
important. This is a minimal set, commands that you should aim to
learn as soon as possible. There are many more, which you will learn
as you start using emacs.

All commands have a verbose version that can be used by pressing ~M-x~
and writing the command. For example, ~M-x find-file~ to open a file.
All major commands are also mapped to a shortcut. For example, instead
of typing ~M-x find-file~ to open a file, you can say ~C-x C-f~. I
remember shortcuts for commands that I use most frequently. For
others, I use the verbose versions. Over time, one learns more
shortcuts and starts using them instead of the verbose versions.

* Customising emacs
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: customemacs
:END:

Emacs is highly customisable. We need several emacs packages and
customisations for our workflow.

*** Install prelude

While emacs may be customised for individual features, using a kit
makes the task easier. [[https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude][Prelude]] is one such kit.

To install Prelude, download it from [[https://github.com/bbatsov/prelude/archive/master.zip][here]] and unzip the files in
~/.emacs.d directory. Better still, clone it using git.

~$ git clone git clone git://github.com/bbatsov/prelude.git ~/.emacs.d~

Windows users should check the location of ~ directory by running
Emacs and typing C-x d ~/<RET>, and then specify the full path.

*** Install additional packages.

Starting version 24, Emacs includes a package-manager. You can
install/update add-on packages using the package manager. To use the
package manager, press M-x in emacs, and then type
package-list-packages and press return. This would bring up a list of
packages.

To mark a package for installation, take the cursor to the item and
press i. Once you have marked the packages you want to install, press
x to execute the installation.

The most critical packages for our use are org-plus-contrib (which
includes org and additional contributed utilities), ess (for running R
code from inside emacs), auctex (for LaTeX) and bibliography
management packages (reftex, org-ref, bibretrieve and ebib). A number
of other packages can be installed to improve the work environment.

Following commands will install all the packages that we need.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp

(package-install-selected-packages)
#+end_src

You can copy the above lines, paste them in an empty (e.g.,
\*scratch\*) buffer, select them, and do M-x eval-region.

*** Further customisations

Most of my remaining customisations are kept in files [[https://github.com/vikasrawal/orgpaper/blob/master/research-toolkit.el][research-toolkit.el]]
and [[https://github.com/vikasrawal/orgpaper/blob/master/vikas-preferences.el][vikas-preferences.el]]. You can download them and save them in
~/.emacs.d/personal/ directory.

These would be loaded automatically next time you start emacs.

* Org-mode basics
** Preamble

An Org file has a few special lines at the top that set up the
environment. Following lines are an example of the minimal set of
lines that we shall use.

#+BEGIN_SRC org
  ,#+TITLE: Using Emacs, Org-mode and R for Research Writing in Social Sciences
  ,#+SUBTITLE: A Toolkit for Writing Reproducible Research Papers and Monographs
  ,#+AUTHOR: Vikas Rawal
  ,#+DATE: May 4, 2014
  ,#+OPTIONS: toc:2 H:3 num:2
#+end_src

As you can see, each line starts with a keyword, and the values for
this keyword are specified after the colon.

Table [[special-lines]] gives details of a few major special lines that we shall use.

#+NAME: special-lines
#+CAPTION: Main special lines to be used at the top of an Org buffer
#+attr_latex: :environment tabularx :width \textwidth :align lX
| Keyword     | Purpose                                                                                                                                                    |
|-------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ~#+TITLE~   | To declare title of the paper                                                                                                                              |
| ~#+AUTHOR~  | To declare author/s of the paper                                                                                                                           |
| ~#+DATE~    | Sets the date. If blank, no date is used. If this keyword is omitted, current date is used.                                                                |
| ~#+OPTIONS~ | There are many options you can give. These are what I find the most important Multiple options can be separated by a space and specified on the same line. |
|             | toc:nil (Do not include a Table of contents), toc:n (Include n levels of sections and sub-sections in Table of contents)                                   |
|             | H:2  (Treat top two levels of headlines as section levels, and anything below that as item list. Modify the number as appropriate)                         |
|             | num:2 (Number top two levels of headlines. Modify the number as appropriate.)                                                                              |

In addition to these, we can use LaTeX specific options for formatting
the pdf output, odt specific options for formatting the odt/docx
output, and R specific options for setting up the R environment. These
would also be specified using special lines at the top of the file. I
shall provide details of some of these in the Sections where these
topics are discussed.

In research monographs prepared using org, you may need quite a few
lines in the preamble to set everything. These would tend to make the
top of the org file look daunting. It may be helpful to store these
lines in a set of separate org files, and include them in your main
document using line such as this:

~#+INCLUDE: path-to-file/papersetup.org~

** Sections and headlines

After the special lines at the top comes the main body of the Org
file.

The content in any Org file is organised in a hierarchy of headlines.
Think of these headlines as sections of your paper.

A headline in Org starts with one or more stars (*) followed by a
space. A single star denotes the main sections, double star denote the
subsections, three stars denote sub-subsections, and so on. We shall
use this to create the section structure of our document. You can
create as many levels of sections as you need.

See the following example. Note that headlines are not numbered. We
leave section numbering for org-mode to handle automatically.

Org handles these headlines beautifully. With your cursor on the
headline, pressing tab folds-in the contents of a headline. If you
press tab on a folded headline, it opens to display the contents. If
there are multiple levels of headlines, these open in stages as you
repeat pressing the tab key.

When you are on a headline, pressing M-return creates a new headline
at the same level (that is, with the same number of stars). Once you
are on the new headline, a tab moves it to a lower level (that is, a
star is added), and shift-tab moves it to a higher level (that is, a
star is removed).

When I start writing a paper, I start with a tentative
headline/section structure, and then start filling in the content
under each headline, and modify the section structure, if needed, as
the paper develops.

(Further reading, [[http://orgmode.org/manual/Headlines.html#Headlines][Headlines]] in Org manual)

** Itemised lists

Following syntax produces unordered (bulleted) lists:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
+ bullet
+ bullet
  - bullet2 1
  - bullet2 2
+ bullet
+ bullet
#+END_SRC

This is how this list shows up in the final document

+ bullet
+ bullet
  - bullet2 1
  - bullet2 2
+ bullet
+ bullet


Following syntax produces ordered/numbered lists:

#+BEGIN_SRC org
1. Item 1
2. Item 2
  1) Item 2.1
  2) Item 2.2
     1) Item 2.2.1
3) Item 3
#+END_SRC

This is how the ordered list shows up in the final document.

1. Item 1
2. Item 2
  1) Item 2.1
  2) Item 2.2
     1) Item 2.2.1
3) Item 3

Note that:
+ In unordered lists, ~+~ and ~-~ signs are interchangeable.
+ Similarly, in ordered lists 1. and 1) are interchangeable.
+ Levels of bullets and numbering are determined by indentation.
+ Ordered and unordered lists can be mixed using numbers and bullets
  for different levels.
+ If the cursor is on a line that is part of an itemised list,
  M-return inserts a new line with a bullet/number below the present
  line with the same level of indentation.

** Inserting footnotes

+ To insert a footnote at any point, use ~C-c C-x f~

+ To reorder and renumber footnotes after inserting a footnote in a
  text that already has some footnotes after the point where a new
  footnote is being inserted, use ~C-u C-c C-x f S~

** Tables
*** Sample code

We shall directly create only those tables in Org that present content
not being produced through statistical analysis. For tables that are
created through statistical analysis, we shall embed R programs rather
than the tables themselves. This is discussed in Section [[#orgmodeandr]]
of this guide.

The following sample code produces a reasonably formatted table, with
a numbered title above the table and a name for cross-referencing the
table from the text anywhere in the document.

See Table [[table-yield]] for an illustration of how this table shows
up in the final document.

#+NAME: one

*** Table editor

Org-mode has an in-built table editor, which is very simple to use.

+ Tables in Org have columns separated using |.
+ Once you create the first row by separating columns using |,
  pressing tabs takes you from the first column to the next. Org
  automatically aligns the columns.
+ At the end of the row, pressing tab again, creates a new blank row.
  You can also create a new blank row by pressing return anywhere in
  the last row.
+ For creating a horizontal line anywhere, type |- at the starting of
  the line, and press tab.
+ Contents of each cell are aligned automatically by Org.
+ To delete a row, use =C-k=.

Org provides various commands for manipulating the design of
tables. Table [[org-table-commands]] provides the most important
ones. Note that Table [[org-table-commands]] is created using Org mode. It
also gives you an idea of how the table would look eventually.

#+NAME: org-table-commands
#+CAPTION: Commands to manipulate tables in Org
#+attr_latex: :environment tabular :width \textwidth :align ll :booktabs t :float t
| Command       | Description                                            |
|---------------+--------------------------------------------------------|
| =M-<left>=    | Move the column left                                   |
| =M-<right>=   | Move the column right                                  |
| =M-S-<left>=  | Delete the current column                              |
| =M-S-<right>= | Insert a new column to the left of the cursor position |
| =M-<up>=      | Move row up                                            |
| =M-<down>=    | Move row down                                          |
| =M-S-<up>=    | Delete the current row or horizontal line              |
| =M-S-<down>=  | Insert a new row above the current row                 |

For more commands for manipulating tables, see [[http://www.orgmode.org/manual/Tables.html][this section of the Org
manual]]. In particular, you may want to look at spreadsheet-like
functions of the table editor.

One limitation of Org is lack of support for merging of cells in a
Table.

** Images

You can insert images in documents as follows

:  [[file:path-to-file/a.jpg]]

You should do this for images that you already have, and you just want
to insert them in the document. For graphs produced by R, we shall
embed the code instead, so that the graph is generated and inserted
automatically.

** Captions and cross-references

We would like to give a title to our tables and images. And we would
like to be able to refer to them from the text. These are achieved by
adding two lines above every table and image.

+ A line starting with ~#+CAPTION:~ placed just above a table or a
  figure adds a title to it. All Tables and Figures titles are
  automatically numbered.

+ For referring to these Tables and Figures in the text, we shall name
  each table and figure in a line starting with ~#+NAME:~ as below.

To illustrate, for inserting an image, with a caption and a name, this
is what we shall do.

#+BEGIN_SRC org
  ,#+NAME: literacy-rate
  ,#+CAPTION: Percentage of literate men and women, by country (per cent)
  [[file:a.jpg]]
#+end_src

Similarly, a table will be inserted as follows.

#+BEGIN_SRC org
  ,#+NAME: literacy-rate-table
  ,#+CAPTION: Percentage of literate men and women, by country (per cent)
  | Country    | Men | Women |
  |------------+-----+-------|
  | India      |  75 |    43 |
  | Bangladesh |  83 |    63 |
  | Rwanda     |  77 |    60 |
#+end_src

To refer to the Table above in the text, write Table
~[[literacy-rate-table]]~. As an illustration, see the following sentence.

#+BEGIN_SRC org
  Tables [[literacy-rate-table]] and [[health-table]], and Figure
  [[literacy-figure]], show the level of underdevelopment.
#+end_src

By default, all objects with captions are numbered, and names are used
to anchor cross-references. When the formatted output is produced, all
the references would be automatically converted to appropriate
numbers. If new objects are inserted in the paper, numbering will be
adjusted automatically when you create the formatted output.

** Formatting tables and images for LaTeX/PDF export

There are many LaTeX packages that can be used to format tables and
images. We shall use org [[http://orgmode.org/manual/Special-blocks.html][special blocks]] for some of this. Lines
starting with [[http://orgmode.org/manual/LaTeX-specific-attributes.html][~#+attr_latex~]] will be used to pass various arguments to
underlying LaTeX commands.

*** Formatting tables using LaTeX tabulary package               :noexport:
The default LaTeX ~tabular~ environment allows only a few column
types. In particular, there is limited support in tabular environment
for wrapping text in different types of columns. However, there are
many other LaTeX environments for making tables, each with its own
advantages. Of the lot, I find ~tabulary~ one of the most useful.

Table [[tabulary-column-types]] shows different types of columns available
in tabulary package.

#+NAME: tabulary-column-types
#+CAPTION: Types of columns in LaTeX/tabulary package
#+attr_latex: :environment tabulary :width \textwidth :align lL :booktabs t
| Type | Description                  |
|------+------------------------------|
| l    | Left aligned, no wrapping    |
| L    | Left aligned with wrapping   |
| r    | Right aligned, no wrapping   |
| R    | Right aligned with wrapping  |
| c    | Centre aligned, no wrapping  |
| C    | Centre aligned with wrapping |
| J    | Justified and wrapped        |

Load tabulary and booktabs using the following line in the preamble.

~#+LATEX_HEADER: \usepackage{tabulary,booktabs}~

The following lines inserted just above the table specify that the
table should use the ~tabulary~ environment.

: #+attr_latex: :environment tabulary :width 0.8\textwidth :align @{}L|llR@{}
: #+attr_latex: :center :booktabs t :float nil

Note that each attr_latex line affects only the object (table, image
or a special block like begin_table or begin_tablenotes) that follows
immediately after.

:width is used to specify the /maximum/ total width of the table that
the table can take [it may be specified as ~\textwidth~, implying full
text width, as ~0.8\textwidth~, implying a fraction (0.8 here) of the
text width, in centimeters (like, 10cm) or in inches (like, 5in)].
Note that, in =tabulary=, the width is the maximum width of the whole
table. If your columns do not need the entire width that you specify,
the table turns out narrower than the width.

~:align~ specifies how to render each columns by using one letter
(l,L,r,R,c,C or J) for each column. The number of letters should
exactly match the number of columns in your table. A ~|~ anywhere
implies a vertical line. ~@{}~ before and after the columns removes a
slight default indentation that LaTeX tabulars insert in the first and
last columns.

~:booktabs t~ gives us nice horizontal lines.

The following code uses tabulary to create a table. The output of the code is shown in Table [[tabulary-yield-out]].

*** Using LaTeX tabularx and siunitx packages

My current setup uses tabularx as the default environment. In
addition, siunitx provides an additional column type S which can be
used to align numbers currently on the decimal.

These two packages and booktabs should be called in the preamble using 

~#+LATEX_HEADER: \usepackage{tabularx,siunitx,booktabs}~

The following code uses tabularx and siunitx to create a table. The
first two lines define a LaTeX command and an org Macro for dealing
with column headers. The output of the code is shown in Table
[[tabularx-yield-out]]. Note the difference in alignment of numbers in
Tables tabulary-yield-out and [[tabularx-yield-out]]. You are advised to
look at the tabularx and siunitx manuals for the many options that
they provide.[fn:1]

*** Notes below tables

LaTeX package =threeparttable= is used for including notes below the
table. For using =threeparttable= you need to call the package. In
addition, it is a good idea to include the following special line for
better formating of notes below the table

: #+LATEX_HEADER: \renewcommand{\TPTminimum}{\linewidth}

The following code produces a table with notes below.

The notes use just a little bit of direct LaTeX coding. ~\item[]~
ensures that /Note/ and /Source/ start from a separate paragraph.

I have used footnotesize to render the notes in a slightly smaller
font. Option [flushleft] is used to align the notes to the left.

* Org-mode and R
:PROPERTIES:
:CUSTOM_ID: orgmodeandr
:END:
** Configuration

Following code in research-toolkit.org enables Org to run different types
of code. If you have installed research-toolkit.org as specified in
[[#customemacs]], these are already enabled.

I have included here the languages that I commonly use. See Org
manual, if you would like to add any more.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(org-babel-do-load-languages
   'org-babel-load-languages
   '((R . t)
     (org . t)
     (ditaa . t)
     (latex . t)
     (dot . t)
     (emacs-lisp . t)
     (gnuplot . t)
     (screen . nil)
     (shell . t)
     (sql . nil)
     (sqlite . t)))
#+END_SRC

** Special lines for R

Org allows you to run multiple R sessions simultaneously, if you are
working on two documents side by side, and would like to keep
statistical work for the two separately.

This is done by naming the R session which a particular Org file is
linked to. All R code in this file would be run in the specified R
session. You could have, at the same time, another R session, with a
different name, being called by another Org buffer.

We can give a name to the R session (let us say, my-r-session) that
our Org buffer should be linked to by adding the following line at the
top (in the preamble, that is).

: #+property: session my-r-session

** Embedding R code in an Org document

Org uses ESS (emacs-speaks-statistics) to provide a fully functional,
syntax-aware, development environment to write R code. R code is
embedded into Org as a source block. The basic syntax is

#+BEGIN_SRC org
  ,#+NAME: name_of_code_block
  ,#+BEGIN_SRC R <switches> <header-arguments>

    <Your R code goes here.>

  ,#+END_SRC
#+END_SRC

This is how source blocks are created.

+ First write the lines starting with ~#+NAME~, ~#+BEGIN_SRC~ and
  ~#+END_SRC~.

+ Then with your cursor in between the ~BEGIN_SRC~ and the ~END_SRC~
  lines, give the command C-c ' (that is, press Ctrl-C, release, and
  press ').

  - This would open a new buffer using ESS mode. If you type your code
    in this buffer, you will see that ESS is syntax-aware and nicely
    highlights R code.
  - ESS also allows you to run (evaluate) the code that you write, to
    test what your code is doing. Use ~C-j~ for evaluating a single
    line of code, ~C-b~ for evaluating the whole ess buffer, or ~C-r~
    for a marked region within the ess buffer.

+ Once you have finished writing a code block and tested it, press
  C-c ' again to come back to your Org buffer.

+ In your Org buffer, with your cursor in a source-block,
  press ~C-c C-c~ to evaluate the whole code block and have the results included
  in your document.

+ You can always edit your source code by opening a temporary ESS
  buffer using C-c'

** Code blocks that read data and load functions for later use in the document without any immediate output

I normally have one or two code blocks that read the data I am going
to use, call the libraries that I use, and define a few functions of
my own that I plan to use. I want this code block to be evaluated, so
that these data, libraries and functions become available in my R
environment. But no output from such code blocks is expected to be
included into the document.[fn:4]

Code block [[readdata-code]] is an example of such a code block. Note
~:results value silent~ switch used in the  ~#+begin_src~ line.

#+NAME: readdata-code
#+BEGIN_SRC org
  ,#+NAME: readdata-code
  ,#+BEGIN_SRC R :results value silent

  read.data("datafile1.csv",sep=",",header=T)->mydata1


  ,#+END_SRC
#+END_SRC

** Code blocks that produce results in the form of a table

Most of code blocks in my papers fall in this category. The code block
may use data and functions made available by previous code blocks,
read some new data and may load some new functions. The code block
does some statistical processing. The last command of the code block
produces an object (for example, a data.frame) that is included in the
document as a Table.

For example, the code block [[r-code-table]] below uses mydata1 read in
the previous code block, reads a new dataset, and processes them to
create a table that shows average BMI by country.

#+NAME: r-code-table
#+BEGIN_SRC org
  ,#+NAME: bmi-table-code
  ,#+BEGIN_SRC R :results value :colnames yes :hline yes
  aggregate(height~Country,data=mydata1,mean)->a1
  read.data("datafile2.csv",sep=",",header=T)->mydata2
  aggregate(weight~Country,data=mydata2,mean)->a2
  merge(a1,a2,by="Country")->a1
  a1$weight/a1$height->a1$BMI
  subset(a1,select=c("Country","BMI"))
  ,#+END_SRC
#+END_SRC

You can evaluate this code using C-c C-c. When you do that, it
produces the output, and places it immediately below the code block.
The results display the output of the code under a line that looks
like below

: #+RESULTS: bmi-table-code

Note that the results are tied to the code block using the name of the
code block. Every time you go to the source code block and press
~C-c C-c~, the code will be evaluated again and the results will be
updated.

On top of the line starting with ~#+RESULTS:~, we shall add two more
lines, to give the table a title and a name. Note that both the code
block and the result of the code block have separate names.

#+BEGIN_SRC org
  ,#+NAME: bmi-table-output
  ,#+CAPTION: Average BMI, by country
  ,#+RESULTS: bmi-table-code
#+END_SRC

Like any Org table, you can cross-refer to this table using
~[[bmi-table-output]]~.

** Code blocks that produce a graph to be included in the document

These code blocks can have a series of commands. The last command
produces a graph that we would like to be included in the document.

The following code shows an example of a code block that produces a
graph.

#+BEGIN_SRC org
 ,#+NAME: mygraph-code
 ,#+BEGIN_SRC R :results output graphics :file bmi2.png :width 825 :height 1050 :fonts serif

 ,#+END_SRC
#+END_SRC

As before, for creating your graph, you first write the ~#+NAME~,
~BEGIN_SRC~ and the ~END_SRC~ lines, and then go into a temporary ESS
buffer by using C-c '.

+ Once in this temporary ESS buffer, you can write the R commands for
  making your graph.
+ As you write, you can evaluate the commands using ~C-j~, ~C-r~ and
  ~C-b~ and see what your output looks like.
+ The output is displayed on your screen using the default graphic
  device used by R (X11, quartz or windows graphic device depending
  upon your operating system).
+ Once you have finalised your graph, you press C-c ' and come back
  to the Org buffer.

Note that creation of the image file is left to appropriate switches
in the ~#+BEGIN_SRC~ line. Org automatically chooses appropriate
graphic device to produce the file. When you evaluate this code using
~C-c C-c~, the results are displayed below the code block as follows.

#+BEGIN_SRC org
  ,#+RESULTS: mygraph-code
  [[bmi2.png]]
#+END_SRC

Note that, taking the file name from our ~#+BEGIN_SRC~ line, a file
called =bmi2.png= was automatically created and linked, so that the
graph would be inserted in the document when you produce the formatted
output.[fn:5] Every time you evaluate the code using ~C-c C-c~, the
underlying image file containing the graph is overwritten by a new
file.

As with the tables, we shall add a caption and a name to it as follows

#+BEGIN_SRC org
  ,#+NAME: my-bmi-graph
  ,#+CAPTION: Average BMI, by Country
  ,#+RESULTS: mygraph-code
  [[gini.png]]
#+END_SRC

You can now refer to this graph in the text using ~[[my-bmi-graph]]~.

* Citations and Bibliographies using Org-mode
** Building your database

We shall use a master bibliographic database to contain bibliographic
records for the literature that we cite. The database, in Biber or
BibTex format, is stored in a text file with .bib extension.

In a BibTex/Biber database, each bibliographic record is given a
unique key, which is used to cite it. Each record is classified as one
among various categories of publications (journal article, book,
etc.), and for the given publication type, the record specifies values
for various fields (author, title, volume, publisher, etc). Biber
recognises a wider variety of publication types and fields than
BibTex, and is a better choice to use. Since it is compatible with
BibTex, you can also add a BibTex record as it is as a Biber record.

To start with, it may be a good idea to use applications like JabRef
(cross-platform, http://jabref.sourceforge.net/) or BibDesk (OS-X
only, http://bibdesk.sourceforge.net/) to build your database.
Eventually, you should use bibretrieve and RefTeX
(http://www.gnu.org/software/auctex/reftex.html) from within Emacs to
add entries to your database. org-ref.el provided by John Kitchin
(https://github.com/jkitchin/jmax) has some useful functions.

Bibliographic information in BibTex/Biber format is available from
many online sources, including Google Scholar. JabRef/BibDesk allow
you to directly import BibTex citations from online databases rather
than having to enter everything yourself. Of course, where the
bibliographic information in BibTex/Biber format is not available from
any existing database, you may have to enter the information yourself.

As a sample, my own bibliographic database is available from
https://github.com/indianstatistics/bibliobase/blob/master/bibliobase.bib.

** Using biblatex with Org
*** Setup
Using biblatex with Org requires some customisation of variables. This
is already done for you if you have installed [[https://github.com/vikasrawal/orgpaper/blob/master/research-toolkit.org][research-toolkit.org]].

The operative part in [[https://github.com/vikasrawal/orgpaper/blob/master/research-toolkit.org][research-toolkit.org]] is the following:
: (setq org-latex-to-pdf-process
:   '("pdflatex %f" "biber %b" "pdflatex %f" "pdflatex %f"))

Once this is done, every time you export the document to pdf via
latex, it runs pdflatex, then runs Biber and then runs pdflatex twice
again. This is necessary to get the citations in the pdf file.

In [[https://github.com/vikasrawal/orgpaper/blob/master/research-toolkit.org][research-toolkit.org]], the package biblatex is loaded with following options:
: ("citestyle=authoryear-icomp,bibstyle=authoryear,hyperref=true,backref=true,
: maxcitenames=3,url=true,backend=biber,natbib=true" "biblatex" t)

You may want to modify this if you want to change the citation and
bibliography styles. If you want to do it differently in each
document, you can remove this line from [[https://github.com/vikasrawal/orgpaper/blob/master/research-toolkit.org][research-toolkit.org]], and add the
following special line in your document.
: #+LATEX_HEADER: \usepackage["citestyle=authoryear-icomp,bibstyle=authoryear, \
: hyperref=true,backref=true,maxcitenames=3,url=true,backend=biber,natbib=true"] {biblatex}

*** Adding citations and bibliography in Latex/PDF export

The following special line, to be placed among other special lines at
the top of the file, specifies the BibTex/Biber database that has the
bibliographic records.

: #+LATEX_HEADER: \addbibresource{filename.bib}

There are various commands that you can use for citations. These use
different styles for citation. The general syntax of citation commands
is:

~\command[<prenote>][<postnote>]{<Key>}~

Where ~[<prenote>]~ refers to any text you want before citation (for
example "for more details, see") and ~[<postnote>]~ refers to any text
you want after citation (for example, "Chapter 2").

The two most useful citation commands are ~\parencite~ (or ~\citep~) and
~\citet~. Their usage is illustrated in Table [[citation-commands]].

#+NAME: citation-commands
#+CAPTION: Important citation commands in biblatex
| Citation command                  | Output                             |
|-----------------------------------+------------------------------------|
| ~\parencite{jon90}~               | (Jones et al., 1990)               |
| ~\parencite[chap. 2]{jon90}~      | (Jones et al., 1990, chap. 2)      |
| ~\parencite[see][]{jon90}~        | (see Jones et al., 1990)           |
| ~\parencite[see][chap. 2]{jon90}~ | (see Jones et al., 1990, chap. 2)  |
| ~\parencite*{jon90}~              | (Jones, Baker, and Williams, 1990) |
| ~\citet{jon90}~                   | Jones et al. (1990)                |
| ~\citet[chap. 2]{jon90}~          | Jones et al. (1990, chap. 2)       |
| ~\citet*{jon90}~                  | Jones, Baker, and Williams (1990)  |

To insert the bibliography, add the following line where you want to
insert the bibliography (usually, at the end of your paper, but before
the Footnotes)

: \printbibliography

* Producing a formatted LaTeX, pdf, odt, docx or html file

From Org, we can get a well-formatted document as a LaTeX, PDF, odt, docx
or html file. To produce a formatted output, we shall use the built-in
exporters provided with Org, and for some file types, use Pandoc for
further conversion.

Built-in exporters can be called in Org using ~C-c C-e~ or ~M-x
org-export-dispatch~.

** Creating LaTeX and/or PDF files

The file [[file:default_packages.org]] lists a set of LaTeX packages that
I normally use. Please modify this as you please, save it in a
convenient location, and call it using a line of the following kind.

~#+INCLUDE: "path/to/default_packages.org"~

For producing LaTeX and/or PDF files, use ~C-c C-e~ to call the Org export dispatcher.

+ Press l to select LaTeX, and then chose one of the following options.
  + Press l again, if you just want to create a LaTeX file
  + Press p, if you want to create a pdf file. This will first create
    a latex file, then use pdflatex and Biber to create a pdf file.
  + Press o, if you want to create pdf and have it opened in the
    default pdf viewing application.

** Creating odt or docx files

There is a built-in odt exporter in Org. While it works well for most
situations, there are two components of the setup proposed here that
it does not support. It does not support biblatex and it does not
support LaTeX-specific solution we have for Notes under Tables and
Images.[fn:6]

Fortunately, [[http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/][Pandoc]] provides an excellent solution for converting
LaTeX output to odt or docx documents. Pandoc supports all the LaTeX
syntax that Org produces from our files, and you can get a very well
formatted output.

Use ~C-c C-e l l~ to create a LaTeX file. Then, from the terminal, use
Pandoc as follows to create an odt or a docx file.

: pandoc --bibliography=biblidatabase.bib --filter pandoc-citeproc \
: latexfile.tex -o outputfile.odt

: pandoc --bibliography=biblidatabase.bib --filter pandoc-citeproc \
: latexfile.tex -o outputfile.docx

If you want, you can use --template to specify an ott or a .dotx
template file, so that the fonts and other formatting attributes are
to your liking.

** HTML

For html as well, there is a built-in exporter in Org. The built-in
exporter is very good, and the way to go if you are planning to
maintain a website using Org (as I do for
http://www.indianstatistics.org).

The built-in exporter can support BibTex citations using ox-BibTex.el,
which is including in Org, and will be loaded if you have installed
[[https://github.com/vikasrawal/orgpaper/blob/master/research-toolkit.org][research-toolkit.org]]. You may need to install BibTex2html separately to make it
work.

However, ox-BibTex.el uses BibTex2html for converting citations and
bibliography to html. BibTex2html provides limited support for
citation and bibliography styles.

If you want full support for bibliography and citation styles, as well
as for other LaTeX components like Table notes explained in this
document, you can use Pandoc for converting LaTeX  to html.

* Additional tips and tricks
This section points some additional solutions that you may like to
use. Some of these may come handy when you start using Org for
documenting your research.

** Evaluating code during export

By default, Org evaluates source code at the time of exporting. If
your code involves a lot of computation, this can slow down exporting.

You can block evaluation of a source code block at the time of export
by using ~:eval never-export~ in the header arguments of the
block. Such code blocks will have to be evaluated manually using ~C-c
C-c~. To prevent all blocks from being evaluated, set it buffer-wide
using:

: #+PROPERTY: header-args :eval never-export~

If your buffer has this line, the source code is not evaluated at the
time of export, and whatever already exists in ~#+RESULTS~ block is
exported.

** Fonts

I like to use the Garamond font. If you do too, add this special line at
the top:

: #+LaTeX_CLASS_OPTIONS: [garamond]



** Margins

In LaTeX, package Geometry allows you to modify page margins. The
following line in [[https://github.com/vikasrawal/orgpaper/blob/master/research-toolkit.org][research-toolkit.org]] sets the margins. You can tweak this to
define the margins as you like.

: ("innermargin=1.5in,outermargin=1.25in,vmargin=1.25in" "geometry" t)

If you would like to do it for each document separately, remove the
above line, and add the following special line at the top in your
documents.

: #+LaTeX_HEADER: \usepackage[innermargin=1.5in,outermargin=1.25in,vmargin=3cm]{geometry}

** Line spacing

Use the following line at the top. Modify the number to whatever suits
you.

: #+LATEX_HEADER: \linespread{1.3}

** Acknowledgements in footnote

When writing a research paper, it is common to put acknowledgements in
a special footnote to names of authors. It is conventional to use * as
the symbol for this footnote, and to keep this footnote out of the
list of numbered footnotes that the paper may have.

This is achieved as follows.

+ As illustrated in the example below, add acknowledgements in the
  special line that specifies authors of the paper.

: #+AUTHOR: Vikas Rawal\footnote{Write your acknowledgements here...}

+ Then, before your first headline, add the following text.

#+BEGIN_SRC org
#+BEGIN_LaTeX
{% begin group
\renewcommand{\thefootnote}{\fnsymbol{footnote}}% set smybols
\setcounter{footnote}{0}% set footnote counter back to 0
}% end group
#+END_LaTeX
#+END_SRC

** Restricting location of tables and images in LaTeX export

LaTeX has a very sophisticated algorithm for determining the location
of Tables and Images in a document. If, however, you want to add a
restriction that the Tables and Images should not cross section
boundaries, or a particular boundary, this can be done using command
~\FloatBarier~ provided by [[http://www.ualberta.ca/afs/ualberta.ca/sunsite/ftp/pub/Mirror/CTAN/help/Catalogue/entries/placeins.html][placeins]] package in LaTeX.

You can put any number of ~\FloatBarrier~ commands, each in a line by
itself, in the document. Tables and Images before such a barrier will
be placed before the barrier.

You can use the following special line at the top to restrict all
Tables and Images within their own sections.

: #+LATEX_HEADER: \usepackage[section]{placeins}

An extension to placeins package, [[http://lexfridman.com/blogs/research/2011/03/06/prevent-figures-from-floating-outside-sections-in-latex/][extraplaceins]] can be used if you
want to restrict the Tables and Images within subsections.[fn:7]

** Customising Biblatex style

I like to use authoryear bibliography style. However, I need some
customisations. The file [[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vikasrawal/orgpaper/master/vikas-bibstyle.org][vikas-bibstyle.org]] contains all my
customisations.

Download the file, adjust the path to the file in the line below and
add it to your org file.

~#+INCLUDE: /path-to-the-file/vikas-bibstyle.org~

[fn:3] Depending on the keyboard and the default configuration of the
flavour of emacs you have installed, Meta may instead be mapped to a
different key (for example, Windows key, or Option or Command key in
Apple computers.

[fn:4] For libraries and functions that you need to call, it is even
better to include them in a .Rprofile file in your working
directory. These libraries and functions would then be called when R
is started, and not each time you evaluate code blocks in your
document.

[fn:5] Of various image formats, I find that png files are most
versatile. png files support transparency, and are rendered well both
on the web and in print. You can also specify jpeg or pdf files. pdf
files for images work very well if you are only going to produce a pdf
document.

[fn:6] Author of the odt exporter has chosen to develop the exporter
outside Org-mode. He has developed a JabRef exporter to integrate
citations into odt exports, but that is not a part of Org-mode and
needs to be installed separately. In any case, since our toolkit
primarily uses LaTeX, using Pandoc to create odt or docx files from
LaTeX export works better.
