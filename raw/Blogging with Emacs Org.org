Right Now, I use two blog systems to post articles. First, I use the Emacs
built-in Org to record my learning on math, computer and wireless
communication. For me, the built-in publishing system is obsolete (I am not
saying Org is obsolete. My life rely heavily on Org.) because I find the
second one is more interesting and flexible to config. The second one is
Hugo. Naturally, the Hugo support markdown format. However, I want to use
Emacs Org to maintain a tools consistency. Fortunately, there is [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/][ox-hugo]], a
project bridging Emacs org and Hugo markdown. Ox-hugo allows you to write
your blog using Emacs Org then publish them in the markdwon format
automatically.

* 1 Writing with Emacs Org publish

It's easy to build a static website using [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Publishing.html][Emacs Org]]. [[https://orgmode.org/worg/][Worg]], the Org-mode
community, also have comprehensive tutorials about using Org to build your
own static site. To be honest, worg should be every serious Org users'
starting point. So many Org experts contribute their summary of Org in
high-quality articles on the Worg.

In general, through Emacs Org mode, all you need is to set the variable
=org-publish-project-alist= . Of course, if you want your site beautiful,
some knowledge about CSS and JavaScript is necessary.

* 2 Writing with Hugo

Now, I moved from the Emacs built-in publishing system to Hugo because of
Hugo's efficiency and flexibility. You can build your static site in just a
few minutues. One major problem of the built-in publishing system is that
you have to wait for a long time as your site gets larger and larger. When
you have only several posts, there is no problem. However, when you have more
than one hundred posts, you want to kill yourself during waiting the
publishing.

Using Hugo, everything is easy. Post an article is at the fingure.However,
if you want to write a post, it is prioritized to finished it in the github
format markdown. For a guy who rarely use markdown and is familiar with
Emacs Org, this constraint is not human. Fortunately, [[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/ox-hugo][Ox-hugo]], a carefuly
crafted Org exporter backend for Hugo, is definitely worth a try. Ox-hugo
bridge the Emacs Org and Hugo and make the workflow at a fly. Even though,
Hugo supports to write the posts in Org format, Ox-hugo still is a sharp
tool which I will not give up and highly recommend it.

Especially, there is tons of themes for you. Also, you can set up your own
theme.

** 2.1 architecture of the site

Using =hugo= , there is a default architecture. Using =ox-hugo= , I store
the Org file in the subdirectory =content-org= . There are several sections
for my static site such =math= , =computer= and =communication= . I store
the articles in the corresponding category. For example I will put an
article on mathematical analysis in the file named =content-org/math.org=
so that after exporting, the markdown file will be put in the subdirectory
=content/math/= .

* 3 Settings for ox-hugo

** 3.1 settings for each section based on ox-hugo

As mentioned before, there are several sections for my site and I use
ox-hugo to handle articles for this sections. In the subdirectory
=content-org/= , there are several =*.org= files such as =math.org= ,
=computer.org= , =communications.org= and =tools.org= . All these =.org=
files have multiple level-1 headlines. for each level-1 headline, there is
one article. I use one-post-per-Org-subtree style preferred in the ox-hugo
[[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/][document]] but one-section-per-Org-file style for each section. The
one-section-per-Org-file style is kind of like one-post-per-Org-file
mentioned in the ox-hugo [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/][document]]. So I have a hybrid style.

For each section, I have to set some parameters properly so that the
articles goes to the right postion. Take =math.org= for example, the
beginning of this file is like:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    #+HUGO_BASE_DIR: ../
    #+HUGO_SECTION: math
    #+SEQ_TODO: TODO NEXT DRAFT DONE
    #+FILETAGS: math
    #+OPTIONS: *:t <:nil timestamp:nil toc:t
    #+HUGO_AUTO_SET_LASTMOD: t
#+END_EXAMPLE

1. the first line tells =ox-hugo= the targeting directory is =../content/= .
2. the second line tells =ox-hugo= the article goes to =../content/math= .
3. the third line is the Org state of the article, =TODO= will render the
   article a draft while =DONE= a finished post.
4. the fourth line will tell the Org all the headlines of this file has the
   tag =math=
5. at the fifth line. =*:t= will toggle emphasized text. =<:nil= means the
   timestamp will not be exported. =timestamp:nil= means the creation time
   will not be exported. =toc:t= means for the articles table of content is
   generated. More settings like these will be detailed in the =Org=
   manual. (You can open the Org manual by =C-h i= ,then seclect the Org
   section.) On table of contents, ox-hugo has an [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/doc/org-toc][article]].
6. the sixth line tells ox-hugo to export the latest time when the article
   is modified.

** 3.2 settings for each article based on ox-hugo

I use the =org-capture= to start a article. The emacs-lisp:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    (setq org-capture-templates
     '(
     ("t" "todo" entry (file "~/zorg/Dropbox/base/zrefile.org")
     "* TODO %? :TODO: \n Added:%T\n"
     :clock-in t :clock-resume t)
     ("h" "Hugo post")
     ("hm" "Math"
     entry (file+olp "~/zorg/zcl.space/content_org/math.org" "Math")
     (function org-hugo-new-subtree-post-capture-template)
     ":math:"
     :clock-in t :clock-resume t)
     ("hc" "Computer"
     entry (file+olp "~/zorg/zcl.space/content_org/computer.org" "Computer")
     (function org-hugo-new-subtree-post-capture-template)
     :clock-in t :clock-resume t)
     ("ht" "Telecommunication"
     entry (file+olp "~/zorg/zcl.space/content_org/telecommunication.org" "Telecommunication")
     (function org-hugo-new-subtree-post-capture-template)
     :clock-in t :clock-resume t)
     ("hl" "Life"
     entry (file+olp "~/zorg/zcl.space/content_org/life.org" "Life")
     (function org-hugo-new-subtree-post-capture-template)
     :clock-in t :clock-resume t)
     ("ho" "Tools"
     entry (file+olp "~/zorg/zcl.space/content_org/tools.org" "Tools")
     (function org-hugo-new-subtree-post-capture-template)
     :clock-in t :clock-resume t)
     ))
#+END_EXAMPLE

From the above code, you can see that I rely heavily on ox-hugo. there is one
function named =org-hugo-new-subtree-post-capture-template= which is shown
as below:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
     (defun org-hugo-new-subtree-post-capture-template ()
     "Returns `org-capture' template string for new Hugo post.
    See `org-capture-templates' for more information."
     (let* (;; http://www.holgerschurig.de/en/emacs-blog-from-org-to-hugo/
     (date (format-time-string (org-time-stamp-format :inactive) (org-current-time)))
     (title (read-from-minibuffer "Post Title: ")) ;Prompt to enter the post title
     (fname (org-hugo-slug title)))
     (mapconcat #'identity
     `(
     ,(concat "* TODO " title)
     ":PROPERTIES:"
     ,(concat ":EXPORT_FILE_NAME: " fname)
     ,(concat ":EXPORT_DATE: " date) ;Enter current date and time
     ,(concat ":EXPORT_HUGO_CUSTOM_FRONT_MATTER+: " ":summary \"summary\"")
     ":END:"
     "%?\n") ;Place the cursor here finally
     "\n")))
#+END_EXAMPLE

One more point, it is awesome to preview each article after saveing it.
Yes! you can do it according [[https://ox-hugo.scripter.co/doc/auto-export-on-saving][this article]].

* 4 Settings for Hugo themes

Now, there are more than 190+ [[https://themes.gohugo.io/][themes]] for Hugo. It is pretty straightforward
to [[https://gohugo.io/themes/][install and config]] a theme as you wish. I prefer the [[https://sourcethemes.com/academic/][Academic theme]] which I
adopt for the following reasons:

1. It is easy manage my post according to different categories.
2. I love the widget most.
3. support of \(\mathrm{\LaTeX}\) so I can with the mathematical expressions
   fluently.
4. Responsive and mobile friendly.
5. easy to update.

   There are [[https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/install/][several ways]] to install the Academic theme. I use the Academic
   Kickstart way:

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
       git clone https://github.com/sourcethemes/academic-kickstart.git My_Website
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   The very reason I use the Kickstart way lies in the updatation of Academic.
   In the Kickstart way, Academic is installed as a Git sub-module.

   If you want to update the theme,all you have to do is:

   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
       git submodule update --remote --merge
   #+END_EXAMPLE

   Also, for different methods of updating the theme, you can check [[https://sourcethemes.com/academic/docs/update/][here]].
