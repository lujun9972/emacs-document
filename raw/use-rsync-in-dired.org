Here's a code snippet I've found long ago on the internet (the source seems to be no longer accessible), that
has proven valuable time and time again:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ;;;###autoload
  (defun ora-dired-rsync (dest)
    (interactive
     (list
      (expand-file-name
       (read-file-name
        "Rsync to:"
        (dired-dwim-target-directory)))))
    ;; store all selected files into "files" list
    (let ((files (dired-get-marked-files
                  nil current-prefix-arg))
          ;; the rsync command
          (tmtxt/rsync-command
           "rsync -arvz --progress "))
      ;; add all selected file names as arguments
      ;; to the rsync command
      (dolist (file files)
        (setq tmtxt/rsync-command
              (concat tmtxt/rsync-command
                      (shell-quote-argument file)
                      " ")))
      ;; append the destination
      (setq tmtxt/rsync-command
            (concat tmtxt/rsync-command
                    (shell-quote-argument dest)))
      ;; run the async shell command
      (async-shell-command tmtxt/rsync-command "*rsync*")
      ;; finally, switch to that window
      (other-window 1)))

  (define-key dired-mode-map "Y" 'ora-dired-rsync)
#+END_SRC

Lets you copy huge files and directories without Emacs freezing up and with convenient progress bar updates.
That is all.

Thanks to tmtxt, the mysterious hacker-person from whom the snippet likely originated . Good luck with getting
your blog back up.
