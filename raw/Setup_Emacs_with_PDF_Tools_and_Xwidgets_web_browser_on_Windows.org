Installation instructions:

* Prerequisite

  * Download Cywing setup from [[https://cygwin.com/install.html][Cygwin's Install page]].
  * If you want only the PDF reader, you can install the Emacs shipped by Cygwin. However, if you also want
    the web browser, then you need to compile your own Emacs 25 from source.

* With PDF reader

[[https://tuhdo.github.io/static/setup-emacs-windows/pdf_tools_windows_latex.gif][DEMO]] (Notice how I press some text in PDF file and Latex buffer jumps to corresponding automatically).

First, don’t use MELPA; you must install pdf-tools manually from this repository. Then, you need to install
Cygwin. The following dependencies are needed:

If you don't plan to use Xwidget browser, just install Emacs from Cygwin:

  * emacs-w32 (Editors category)

Then install the tool chain for PDF Tools:

  * make (Devel category)
  * gcc-core (Devel category)
  * gcc-g++ (Devel category)
  * autoconf (Devel category)
  * automake (Devel category)
  * perl (Perl category)

Then install Poppler development library:

  * libpoppler-devel (Lib category)
  * libpoppler-glib-devel (Lib category)

Just type the dependency name above and click to choose. For example, enter libpoppler-devel into the search
box.

After all dependencies installed, clone pdf-tools:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  git clone https://github.com/politza/pdf-tools
#+END_SRC

Then, go into pdf-tools directory and build it:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  make
#+END_SRC

When the compilation is done, from your Cygwin Terminal, copy the file server/epdfinfo.exe into /usr/bin/:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  cp server/epdfinfo.exe /usr/bin/
#+END_SRC

Then, also within Cygwin, run emacs command. Within Emacs, run the Emacs command:

  * M-x package-install-file
  * Press RET
  * Select pdf-tools-${VERSION}.tar RET (the tar file is in your repository).

Finally, run pdf-tools-install and enjoy. Here is the configuration you can put in your init file:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (pdf-tools-install)
  (setq pdf-info-epdfinfo-program "/usr/bin/epdfinfo.exe")
#+END_SRC

* With Xwidgets browser

[[https://tuhdo.github.io/static/setup-emacs-windows/emacs_xwidgets_windows.png][DEMO]]

Development libraries for building Emacs that supports Xwidgets:

  * libgif-devel (Graphics category)
  * libtiff-devel (Lib category)
  * libjpeg-devel (Devel category)
  * libxpm-devel (Devel category)
  * libgnutls-devel (Devel category)
  * libpng-devel (Devel category)
  * libncurses-devel (Lib category)
  * libgtk3-drivel (Lib category)
  * libwebkitgtk3.0-devel (Lib category)

Then, install X11 server for displaying Emacs:

  * xorg-server (X11 category)
  * xinit (X11 category)

Then, open Cygwin terminal and compile Emacs:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  ./configure --with-xwidgets
  make
  make install
#+END_SRC

Finally, set your display:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  echo "export DISPLAY=:0.0" >> .bash_profile
#+END_SRC

Then, from your Start Menu, open the X server:

[[https://tuhdo.github.io/static/setup-emacs-windows/xserver_example.png][xserver_]]

Then, run your compiled Emacs 25 from Cygwin terminal:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
  emacs
#+END_SRC
